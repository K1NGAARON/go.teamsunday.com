                ION: in style on the slopes
            </p>
            <p>
                How can we go about thanking our employees for their efforts they thought at ION. A bottle of champagne is always a nice gift but sometimes it could be a more original gift that people will enjoy for a long time to come.
                <br><br>
                On the calendar that period was a fantastic ski trip with the team. Next Level team building!
                With this trip in mind, a branded Christmas sweater was chosen. This was quickly followed by a pair of personalized socks and a fully customized beanie. 
                All clothing items were designed so that they could immediately be linked to ION: their typical brand guidelines with ION red were incorporated into the designs.
                For this winter package they deliberately chose a minimalist design so that it was very wearable and appeals to a wide audience: both young and older colleagues could wear this design and be enthusiastic about it.

                Sporty employer branding campaign
            </h2>
            <p>
                After this initial collaboration, ties were forged and they began working on other campaigns at ION where they again wanted to put their employees at the center.
                <br><br>
                ION's marketing and HR department put their heads together to create a successful employer branding campaign. The company was looking for several new colleagues but wanted to appeal to potential new employees in a creative way. The idea was to participate with some sporty colleagues in the 10 miles in Antwerp (large running event). Each of these colleagues wore the same t-shirt in ION branding with the text "GIVE UP your job." on the back. And join us". 
                <br><br>
                A playful campaign that was spread by employees, created brand awareness and also boosted the team atmosphere.

                21 ION babies made the national news
            </h2>
            <p>
                That the ION team loves #actION was proved once again when they were able to welcome a whopping 21 babies in 21 months.
                <br><br>
                Some 150 people work at project developer ION in Waregem. Of these, 20 employees have recently become mom or dad. "We have a very young team, so it is not surprising that babies are born, but this is really punishing," says Lies Van Biervliet, HR Business partner at ION. In just 21 months, 21 babies have been born, one employee had twins, hence 20 parents for 21 babies.  "That's some puzzling, but with the necessary flexibility, we'll solve that," she said.
                <br><br>
                The baby boom was already celebrated in the company in a big way: with a festive brunch for parents and kids alike. There were play mats on the floor and there was vegetable porridge for the babies. All employees also received a goodie bag to take home with a baby hoodie.
                <br><br>
                by dressing all the kids in the same attire, it was once again clear, even visually, that ION functions as one big team. 
                <br><br>
                With this story, they even made the news in Belgium! Even though it posed a challenge for the company to get everything right, they made a nice campaign around it that was not only appreciated by colleagues but also picked up and applauded externally.
