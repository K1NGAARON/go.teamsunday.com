                Reward and motivate employees
            </p>
            <p>
                We, too, strongly believe that this approach contributes enormously to the productivity of employees. A team that does sports together feels better, gets more energy and generates better results.
                <br><br>
                Next to organizing several sports events, creating a Strava challenge or building a company gym, everybody loves a good team building. It brings the team together and helps everyone to bond more. Yet the challenge is that the effect of a team building is limited in time. This means that the ROI of a team building is sometimes very short. With branded fashion clothing team events become unforgettable. A challenge Silverfin well understood.

                Branded sportswear

            <p>
                Together we started creating their own branded sports collection to boost an active lifestyle within their company culture. By creating unique sportswear for your workplace sports program, we helped increase the participation rate at Silverfin. Their team members will start running or walking in their branded sportswear and will motivate other team members to join. In addition to that, Silvefin gets a big boost and will be perceived as an active and sporty company. And even attract highly motivated employees.

            <p>
                Silverfin wanted to send a strong signal to their people with the purchase of the 'branded' sports jerseys and thereby promote their vision. They noticed that this initiative was very well received. Both during and after working hours they see the clothing appear. As it contributes enormously to the community feeling - another aspect to which great importance is attached. 
                <br><br>
                The best sportswear campaigns for workplace sports are the ones that perfectly match with your company on the one hand, and the sports event on the other hand. An ideal unique workplace sports approach we created for Silverfin. 
                <br>br
                Admit it, that's a result that every company wants to achieve. A strong community and extra visibility!
