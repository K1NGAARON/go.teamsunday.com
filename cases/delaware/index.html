                Delaware: developing, innovating and implementing international business consulting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Who is delaware? A global company that delivers advanced IT solutions and services, guiding organizations through their business and digital transformations. Through partnerships with SAP, Microsoft, Salesforce and OpenText, they provide companies with the tools to achieve their mission-critical priorities and future-proof their businesses. Today, more than 3000 delaware professionals are working in 14 countries spread over Europe, Asia and the US. 
                <br><br>
                Not to underestimate, managing a global team is challenging. A recent survey found that only 18 percent of multinational corporations feel they have a strong leadership pipeline in place to meet future business challenges. Nonetheless, delaware is aware that by instilling their employees with a sense of shared purpose and leveraging collaborative technology, you can create an atmosphere of trust and achieve its business objectives. 
                <br><br>
                Yet, delaware wanted to go that extra mile. They wanted to boost the feeling of team spirit through the use of company fashion. Strong team spirit will lead to a high performing team and if there's one thing that drives #peopleofdelaware, it's that they share a passion for performance. Team spirit is therefore one of their five corporate values.

            </h2>
            <p>
                delaware and sports are a match! Wanting to make their next company sports event, “Sporty B1” a great success, made them knock on the Sunday door. So together we created a collection of sportswear made exclusively available for the entire delaware team. From a sports challenge with the team to a vacation with their cycling team, their custom sports and cycling wear will create a lasting positive memory and boost their team spirit to the fullest. 
                <br><br>
                The best sport campaigns at the workplace are the ones that perfectly match with your company on the one hand, and your employees on the other hand. We designed kits. Because we're working with sublimation, we were able to use the exact pantone colors from the delaware brandbook. We created  two outfits featuring the dashing delaware-red, one for the allround athletes including wind jackets, sports shorts and matching sports shirts. Secondly, we created   shorts/tights, jerseys (short sleeves) and cycling jacks (long sleeves) for the cycling enthusiasts.
                <br><br>
                Our sportswear is made from the highest quality polyester and matches the best industry standards, a fact confirmed by Alejandra Ranson, Marketing Professional at delaware. "Our cyclists are very passionate athletes so if they enjoy using the cycling wear then we can call it a great success. The reason why we chose to work with Sunday is a list of multiple positive points. Next to the high quality products, we were really convinced of the design possibilities."

                delaware was impressed with the quality and design of the sports items. They generated positive brand awareness outside in running competitions, the gym and other sports clubs and even internationally. The delaware employees are through the roof with their new sportswear, they feel proud to represent delaware during their sports sessions and feel encouraged to work out together! In this way they wanted to boost their team spirit, including employee retention and employee well-being.
