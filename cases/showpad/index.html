                Showpad: The platform for modern selling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Showpad is the leading sales enablement platform for the modern seller. Founded in 2011, the company has headquarters in Ghent and Chicago with offices in London,
                Munich, San Francisco and Portland. By integrating industry leading training and coaching software with content solutions their platform empowers sales and marketing teams
                to engage buyers. Showpad serves more than 1200 customers across the globe, including Johnson & Johnson, BASF, GE Healthcare, Fujifilm, Bridgestone, Prudential and Merck.
                <br><br>
                As told above, Showpad competes with the largest companies worldwide. As well as their employees want to compete in sports challenges with teams worldwide.
                They even have a sports committee that organizes challenges and joins different sporting events.
                <br><br>
                There is a large demand in Showpad to activate the employees and compete in sports challenges between different teams across the world. But there's something missing.
                All the employees should show the Showpad colors while doing sports. All there was left to do was creating the sports collection in order to transform the Showpadders into true brand ambassadors.

                "We commit. We deliver"
            </h2>
            <p>
                delaware and sports are a match! Wanting to make their next company sports event, “Sporty B1” a great success, made them knock on the Sunday door. So together we created a collection of sportswear made exclusively available for the entire delaware team. From a sports challenge with the team to a vacation with their cycling team, their custom sports and cycling wear will create a lasting positive memory and boost their team spirit to the fullest. 
                <br><br>
                The best sport campaigns at the workplace are the ones that perfectly match with your company on the one hand, and your employees on the other hand. We designed kits. Because we're working with sublimation, we were able to use the exact pantone colors from the delaware brandbook. We created  two outfits featuring the dashing delaware-red, one for the allround athletes including wind jackets, sports shorts and matching sports shirts. Secondly, we created   shorts/tights, jerseys (short sleeves) and cycling jacks (long sleeves) for the cycling enthusiasts.
                <br><br>
                Our sportswear is made from the highest quality polyester and matches the best industry standards, a fact confirmed by Alejandra Ranson, Marketing Professional at delaware. "Our cyclists are very passionate athletes so if they enjoy using the cycling wear then we can call it a great success. The reason why we chose to work with Sunday is a list of multiple positive points. Next to the high quality products, we were really convinced of the design possibilities."

            </h2>
            <p>
                delaware was impressed with the quality and design of the sports items. They generated positive brand awareness outside in running competitions, the gym and other sports clubs and even internationally. The delaware employees are through the roof with their new sportswear, they feel proud to represent delaware during their sports sessions and feel encouraged to work out together! In this way they wanted to boost their team spirit, including employee retention and employee well-being.
